# physics-engine

This is an attempt to make a 2d "physics engine" with shape collision, rotation, gravity, etc. JavaScript is being used to draw on HTML canvas. No libraries are used.

Goals:
* User can create polygons of any size/shape
* All complex polygons with any number of sides supported
* Polygons collide, are affected by gravity/other forces
* Polygons realistically rotate
